# Metadata extraction and generation

## Aim

Aim is to utilise machine learning (ML) to extract and generate metadata from the existing files by creating, training and improving a model (Nerual Network) to process currently existing files and the filestructures to extract labled metadata such as project date-time, dimensionality, projetc name and/or other metadata.

## Subprojects

- Filepath metadata extraction: extract different metadata from the file path of each file. (Current)
- Document metadata extraction: extract different metadata from coduments such as pdf reports.
- Hierarchical analysis and metadata sharing: copy metadata to related files based on hierachicl structure.
